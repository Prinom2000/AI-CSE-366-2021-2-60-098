I worked about battery section over the path. Algorithms are first used for leaf finding. Then the battery is decreage by loop over path array.

If it falls below 10%, the battery will be recharged.

There is no difference between UCS and Ester Search in my code. Because I figured out path  first and then worked on it. 
But generally among them A* serch is very efficient in search. Through the heuristic function, it knows in advance how far the destination is. 
But in case of UCS search it has to do backtracking.
