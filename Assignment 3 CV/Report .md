### Introduction
- **Objective:** Compare a custom CNN model with the pre-trained VGG16 model for classifying plant leaf images into different deficiency classes.
- **Dataset:** CoLeaf Dataset, excluding 'healthy' and 'iron-Fe' classes.

### Methodology

#### Data Augmentation
- **Why:** To increase the number of images and improve model performance.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Rescaling
  - Shearing
  - Zooming
  - Rotating
  - Shifting
  - Flipping

#### Custom CNN Model
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load images and apply data augmentation.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Three convolutional blocks (Conv2D + MaxPooling2D).
   - Fully connected layer with 128 neurons and dropout.
   - Output layer with softmax activation.
3. **Training:**
   - Compile with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
   - Use early stopping to avoid overfitting.
   - Train the model with 20% data for validation.

#### VGG16 Model
1. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Balance classes by augmenting images to have at least 200 images per class.
2. **Model Preparation:**
   - Load VGG16 without top layers and freeze its weights.
   - Add custom layers (Flatten, Dense, Dropout, Output).
3. **Training:**
   - Compile with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
   - Use early stopping.
   - Train with augmented data, using 20% for validation.

### Evaluation

#### Custom CNN Model
- **Test Accuracy:** Achieved high accuracy on the test set.
- **Training Time:** Moderate, due to smaller architecture.

### Comparison
- **Accuracy:**
  - Both models performed well, with VGG16 slightly better in some cases.
- **Training Time:**
  - VGG16 took longer to train.
- **Model Complexity:**
  - Custom CNN is simpler and faster.
  - VGG16 is more complex but pre-trained on a large dataset.

### Conclusion
- **Custom CNN:**
  - Easier to train.
  - Good accuracy with less complexity.
- **VGG16:**
  - Higher accuracy.
  - Takes longer to train but benefits from pre-trained features.

### Future Work
- Experiment with other pre-trained models.
- Fine-tune models for better performance.
- Explore more data augmentation techniques.
